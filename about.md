This is the personal blog of Fauziah Zin - I'm a web developer of 10+ years and have been fiddling with computers in general for even longer. 
I've been keeping notes and ideas in various text files over the years (usually in files called notes.txt - hence the name of this blog!) - and this blog is an attempt to share some of the more useful ones to the world.
