##Hello World
This is basically a place to put all my dev-related notes and thoughts online. 

##Finding a blogging platform
Wordpress seems overkill for what basically is a collection of notes in simple text files and Markdown files. Github Pages + Jekyll static site generator
seems perfect for what I need.
